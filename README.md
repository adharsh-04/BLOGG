Blogg Application
Blogg is a blogging platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to read, comment, and like blog posts, while authors can create, edit, manage, and delete their own blog posts. This platform also provides features like soft deletion and restoration of blog posts for authors.

Features
User Features:
Login & Registration: Users can log in and register with their credentials.

View Blog Posts: Users can view all published blog posts written by various authors.

Like Blog Posts: Users can like any blog post they find interesting.

Comment on Blog Posts: Users can comment on blog posts and interact with the authors and other readers.

Author Features:
Login as Author: Authors can log in using their author credentials.

Create Blog Posts: Authors can create new blog posts, add titles, descriptions, and images.

View Own Posts: Authors can view, edit, and manage their own articles.

Soft Delete Blog Posts: Authors can temporarily hide their blog posts by soft deleting them (marks them as deleted but doesnâ€™t remove them from the database).

Restore Deleted Blog Posts: Authors can restore soft-deleted posts back to the active state if they wish to republish them.

How It Works:
Users and authors log in using their credentials.

Users can browse and interact with blog posts by liking them or leaving comments.

Authors have more control over their content, including the ability to create, update, and delete their own posts.

Soft deletion allows authors to hide their posts temporarily, but these posts can always be restored.

This platform provides a flexible and user-friendly environment for reading, creating, and managing blog posts, making it suitable for personal blogging or even collaborative blogging spaces.
